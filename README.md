# voximplant-docs
A new GitHub-based Voximplant documentation website

Currently work in progress by Avi and Irina M.

## Voximplant documentation syntax guide
[Edit this file](https://github.com/followmyutopia/voximplant-docs/edit/main/README.md) to see the syntax:

### Basic markdown
Pound symbols # are the headers. Please note, that in Voximplant articles, there's only one level-one header #, and it is shown in the document tree. All the rest headers should be level-two ## or more (up to level-six).

Surround some text with double asterisks ** for **bold text**, with single underscore _ for _italics_.

- To create a dotted list,
- use the hyphen "-" prefix

1. To create a numbered list,
1. use the 1. prefix
