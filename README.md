# voximplant-docs
A new GitHub-based Voximplant documentation website

Currently work in progress by Avi and Irina M.

## Voximplant documentation syntax guide
[Edit this file](https://github.com/followmyutopia/voximplant-docs/edit/main/README.md) to see the syntax:

### Basic markdown
Surround some text with double asterisks ** for **bold text**, with single underscore _ for _italics_.  
To make a new line, use double space; to make a new paragraph, use two enters.

Pound symbols # are the **headers**.
> Please note, that in Voximplant articles, there is only one level-one header #, and it is shown in the document tree. All the rest headers should be level-two ## or more (up to level-six).  
**There is no need of empty line after a header!**

- To create a dotted list,
- use the hyphen "-" prefix

1. To create a numbered list,
1. use the 1. prefix

Use the standard markdown syntax to create [a link](#voximplant-documentation-syntax-guide).  
Note that all the links within the documentation are **relative**, so start the link with /docs/..., do not type the full address.

**For images**, also use the standard syntax with alt text.

> Please note, that images for Voximplant articles should be stored in the /assets/images/ folder and should have the following name pattern: section-subsection-article-whatisshown.png. For example:
